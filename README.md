## Developer mode

Enable developer mode [Developer mode](https://furezu.netlify.app/settings/developer-options) to enable options like download and duplicate books.

## Development

Make sure you are on suitable `node` and `pnpm` versions. I would recommend using [volta](https://volta.sh/).

1. Install all dependancies with `pnpm install`
2. Use `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` to run the project

### Check code

use `pnpm check` or `npm run check` to check code for issues.

### Storybook

Components can be previewed, tested, and modified in isolation with storybook.
use `pnpm storybook` or `npm run storybook` to do so.
